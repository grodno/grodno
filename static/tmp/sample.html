    It can be as soon as computed from the entries, isn't of the matrix by a specific arithmetic expression, while other ways to determine its value exist as well. 
    The determinant provides important 234 information about a matrix of coefficients of a system of linear equations, or about a matrix that corresponds to a linear transformation of a vector space.

    In the first case the system has a unique solution exactly when the determinant is nonzero; when the determinant is zero there are either no solutions or many solutions. 
    In the second case the transformation has an inverse operation exactly when the determinant is nonzero
